                    <p>Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari says social media is threatening to undermine national security, and has called for an end to hate speech.

                        In an address to mark Nigeria's independence day, President Buhari urged people to exercise restraint and tolerance when discussing religious and political issues.
                        
                        His remarks come just a day after an activist and former presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore, pleaded not guilty in court to several charges, including sharing information online that insulted or caused people to hate the president.
                        
                        Whilst the Nigerian president is calling for tolerance, rights groups criticise his administration for a deteriorating human rights record, especially due to the use of deadly force against a now-banned Shia group.
                        
                        
                        
                        How Nigeria and its president are being held to ransom
                        
                        The pomp and ceremony of Muhammadu Buhari's inauguration will not mask the huge challenges the 76-year-old Nigerian president faces during his second term in office - in particular the booming business of kidnapping for ransom.
                        
                        Even one of the president's relations - a traditional ruler in Daura in northern Nigeria - is currently being held after he was seized from outside his house earlier this month by gunmen.
                        
                        In March, a well-known Muslim cleric in Kano, who campaigned for Mr Buhari ahead of his re-election, was held for 12 days by kidnappers demanding $833,000 (£657,000) for his release.
                        
                        
                        
                        "Eight young men were assigned to guard us. They would smoke cigarettes and marijuana and blow the smoke into the hut, abusing and threatening to kill us since our people didn't care to bring the ransom in time. They issued all sorts of threats," Ahmed Sulaiman told the Daily Trust newspaper, adding that his freedom was secured as part of a prisoner swap.
                        
                        Gangs nationwide kidnap both rich and poor people, often collecting ransoms of up to $150,000 - and sometimes killing abductees whose families fail to pay.

                        Nigeria became a British protectorate in 1901. Colonization lasted until 1960, when an independence movement succeeded in gaining Nigeria its independence. Nigeria first became a republic in 1963, but succumbed to military rule three years later after a bloody coup d'état.
